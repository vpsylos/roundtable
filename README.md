A proof-of-concept ticketing system for a tech support office in my university.

## How to run
First, click on the Code button and download the zip file. Then, create and activate a virtual environment. Then, download all the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## First run
When you first launch the program, you will be prompted to create an admin account. Once this has been done, you can log in to the system.

## Features
You can:
- Add users served by your tech support office, their computers, as well as any ticket concerning the former two.
- Search for users and computers, and view their details.
- Edit already existing user, computer, or ticket data.
- Use the admin panel to add or delete technicians to your team, as well as delete user and/or computer data.
